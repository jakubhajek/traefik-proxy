# Traefik Proxy running on Docker Swarm 

This is a basic example on how to depoy Traefik Proxy with example service WhoAmi on Docker Swarm. 

## Prerequisities

You need to have a Swarm cluster, so let's initiated: `docker swarm init`

# Let's deploy it

The cluster that consists of one node has been created. You can deploy your stack and start exploring all Traefik advantages. 

`docker stack deploy traefik-stack -c traefik-stack.yaml --prune`

# Let's test it

The below command display the service created in stack file:

```
âžœ docker service ls
ID             NAME                    MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                   PORTS
